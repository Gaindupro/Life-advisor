            <h2>Our Founders</h2>
            <p>
                Life Advisor was created by two passionate teenagers, Gaindu and Shenal, who are 17 years old. Despite their young age, both of them have worked tirelessly to develop this website to help people from all walks of life. Gaindu and Shenal are deeply interested in technology, personal growth, and providing valuable insights to users based on data analysis. They believe that by empowering individuals with the right information, people can navigate their lives with confidence.
            </p>
            <p>
                As 17-year-old developers, Gaindu and Shenal have dedicated countless hours to building this platform. They learned how to code, design, and manage the entire project themselves. With a vision of making life easier for others, they combined their skills in web development, data analysis, and design to create Life Advisor—a tool that’s both easy to use and insightful.
